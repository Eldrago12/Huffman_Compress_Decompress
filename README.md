# Huffman_Compress_Decompress

This project implements Huffman compression and decompression using C++ for the backend, with a Python Flask application serving as the frontend. The application is deployed on an AWS Ubuntu server.

## Overview

The project consists of two main components:

1. **C++ Backend**:
   - Huffman compression and decompression algorithms implemented in C++.
   - Source files are located in the `cpp/` directory.

2. **Python Flask Frontend**:
   - A web interface built with Python Flask to interact with the compression and decompression functionalities.
   - HTML and CSS files are located in the `templates/` and `static/` directories, respectively.
   - The Flask application is defined in `app.py`.

## Features

- Huffman compression and decompression of text files.
- Web interface for user interaction.
- AWS deployment for remote accessibility.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites/Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Python (for Flask)
- AWS account for deployment

### Installation
